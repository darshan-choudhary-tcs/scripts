To set up a local Drupal environment using Homebrew on macOS, follow these steps. Youâ€™ll be installing the necessary software, including PHP, MySQL, Apache (or Nginx), and Composer. Once everything is installed, you can set up Drupal.
### Prerequisites:
- Homebrew installed on your macOS.
### Step 1: Install PHP
You can install PHP using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install php
```
After installation, start the PHP service:
```bash
brew services start php
```
### Step 2: Install MySQL
Next, install MySQL:
```bash
brew install mysql
```
After installation, start the MySQL service:
```bash
brew services start mysql
```
You can secure MySQL by running:
```bash
mysql_secure_installation
```
This will guide you through setting up a root password and securing MySQL.
### Step 3: Install Apache (Optional if you don't have it)
You can use Apache, which comes with macOS, or install it using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install httpd
```
Start the Apache service:
```bash
brew services start httpd
```
You can configure Apache to work with PHP by modifying the `httpd.conf` file.
### Step 4: Install Composer
Drupal uses Composer for managing PHP dependencies. Install it using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install composer
```
### Step 5: Create a Drupal Project
You can now create a new Drupal project using Composer:
```bash
composer create-project --repository-url="https://repo.packagist.com/pfizer/" pfizer/{subscription}:dev-dev --stability dev -vvv foldername
```
This will create a `{{subscription}}` directory with the Drupal core, modules, themes, and other essential files.

### Step 6: Set Up a Virtual Host (Apache)
Edit your Apache configuration file to set up a virtual host for your Drupal site:
```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
```
Add a new virtual host configuration similar to the following:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
   DocumentRoot "/path/to/my_drupal_site/web"
   ServerName mydrupalsite.local
<Directory "/path/to/my_drupal_site/web">
       AllowOverride All
       Require all granted
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
Replace `/path/to/my_drupal_site/web` with the actual path to your Drupal installation.
Restart Apache:
```bash
brew services restart httpd
```
### Step 7: Modify `/etc/hosts`
To make your local domain work, add the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file:
```bash
127.0.0.1 mydrupalsite.local
```
### Step 8: Create a Database for Drupal
Log in to MySQL and create a database for your Drupal installation:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Then run:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE drupal;
```

### Step 9: Finalize and Test
Once you've installed Drupal, you can start building your site locally. Make sure to restart all services after changes to your configuration files.
```bash
brew services restart php
brew services restart mysql
brew services restart httpd
```
Your local Drupal environment should now be fully set up and ready to use.
